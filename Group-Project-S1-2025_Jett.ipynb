    "#1: Forecasting Problem:\n",
    "The purpose of this problem is to create a forecasting model which can estimate an AirBnB listing price within Melbourne, based on appropriately selected features within a regression model which can encapsulate what dictates a high or low listing price. This can be applied within the real world through property owners seeking to find an appropriate price to rent out their property on AirBnB, this maximising their potential earnings without pricing themselves out of the market with a high price, or simply not getting enough utility out of the property by utilizing a low price. Both of which are prevalent risks through adopting an uninformed guess. AirBnB themselves could utilize this model to find ensure optimal pricing, maximizing their revenue Finally, It is also possible for individuals seeking to rent a property on the AirBnB service to utilize the model to ensure they are getting a fair deal on a property based on its features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#2 Evaluation Criteria\n",
    "The criterion of Mean Absolute Error to assess forecasting performance has both pros and cons. \n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "Compared to mean squared error, the model is less sensitive to outliers, with an error of X simply contributing X to the mean squared error. If we were using mean squared error as our metric, an error of X would be amplified to X^2. This causing a large error to have a significant effect on the models reported error. Meaning the model would likely be too sensitive to outliers An example being an error of 100 being squared to 10000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "Not utilizing a percentage based metric causes the severity of errors to be understated specifically on cheaper properties. This as MAE ignores the size of the principle, and is not a relative calculation unlike MAPE which would recognise the severity of an error more effectively. This as an error of 300 should be considered be more significant under a property listed for 500 dollars compared to 2500, due to the size of the error relative to the pricing (60% vs 12%). This meaning the metric may not be the most appropriate due to the commonly wide range of real estate rental prices.\n",

This including bedrooms (378 training, 60 test), as well as review scores specifically within the test dataset.\n",

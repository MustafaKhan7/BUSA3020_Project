    "## Task 1.1: Forecasting Problem – Explanation and Real-World Application\n",
    "\n",
    " ### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "   This competition presents a **supervised regression problem**, where the objective is to predict a **continuous target \n",
    "   variable**—the `price` of Airbnb listings—based on various input features. These features may include property \n",
    "   characteristics such as room type, location, availability, and number of reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Relevance\n",
    "\n",
    " Accurately forecasting Airbnb prices carries significant value for multiple stakeholders:\n",
    "\n",
    "  #### Hosts\n",
    "  Hosts can leverage price prediction models to **set competitive and optimal prices** for their properties. This can lead to \n",
    "  **increased occupancy rates** and **higher revenue**, particularly in dynamic markets where pricing strategies need to \n",
    "  adjust based on demand and seasonality.\n",
    "\n",
    "  #### Guests\n",
    "  Guests benefit from such models through **improved price transparency** and **comparison tools** that help them identify \n",
    "  listings offering better value for money. This enhances the user experience and builds trust in the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ####  Platform Operators (e.g., Airbnb)\n",
    "  For the platform itself, predictive pricing supports **automated dynamic pricing algorithms**. These systems adjust listing \n",
    "  prices in real time based on factors such as:\n",
    "  - Market demand fluctuations\n",
    "  - Seasonal patterns\n",
    "  - Local events\n",
    "  - Competitor pricing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 1.2: Evaluation Criteria – Mean Absolute Error (MAE)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metric Used\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation metric used in this competition is **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**.  \n",
    "MAE measures the average magnitude of the errors between predicted and actual values, without considering their direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of MAE\n",
    "- ✅ **Easy to interpret**: The error is in the same unit as the target variable (e.g., dollars).\n",
    "- ✅ **Robust to outliers**: Unlike metrics that square the error, MAE treats all errors linearly and does not give extra weight to large deviations.\n",
    "- ✅ **Intuitive for business stakeholders**: It directly reflects the average error in predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations of MAE\n",
    "- ❌ **Does not penalize large errors** as harshly as other metrics like MSE (Mean Squared Error), which may be important in some contexts.\n",
    "- ❌ **Non-differentiable at zero**: While not a concern for this task, it can be less convenient for certain optimization algorithms in advanced model training.\n",
